What a journey that 80% of downs could surprisingly teach me a valuable lessons that maybe I couldn&rsquo;t experienced it in any other life stages. I would recap, as a reflection, the valuable wisdoms I&rsquo;ve learned throughout the year.</p><h2 id=hardship-is-a-gift>Hardship is a gift<a href=#hardship-is-a-gift class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><p>Starting the year of 2023 with no energy, no purpose, and aimlessly didn&rsquo;t know what I did. I barely adapted the city that I lived in. For me, Jakarta is not a friendly place to live alone. As I also promised to myself to never complain for any obstacles I faced, which makes the stakes higher.</p><p>The best turning point was when I gradually eager want to know myself in a void. I read and research about the way of life from many sources. And turns out, I realized that the hardship is given to us as an enabler to get to know ourselves better by learning from what it offers.</p><p>Hardship doesn&rsquo;t mean something is wrong, but it means something is teaching us, something wants us to learn. Hardship is a gift.</p><h2 id=our-body-is-capable-to-hack-their-own>Our body is capable to hack their own<a href=#our-body-is-capable-to-hack-their-own class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><p>This interesting topic had popped up from my mind because of the depression-like syndrome that I wanted to tackle off. I did a small research about this topic. And the reason is because of unbalanced chemical in our brain. So, I started to hack it.</p><p>Starting to rearrange the food I eat, modify the habit, exercising, until radically change the mindset. Small amount of substance in a food we eat could affect our homeostasis. So be mindful to choose the food. Habit also contributes unbalanced chemical. As every person has their own style of habit, it&rsquo;s our responsibility to arrange the habit that suits us.</p><h2 id=small-but-consistent>Small but consistent<a href=#small-but-consistent class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><p>I started my running journey when my friend told me to join running event, Jakarta Half-Marathon. After this event, I really excited to do more. So I do running in a weekly basis. It progressed from 5K to 10K to 17K and more. I started small first, then gradually increased the mileage. I never expected could do 20K weekly running. The key is to do small thing in consistent manner so we don&rsquo;t feel overwhelmed on a big thing ahead.</p><hr><p>There&rsquo;s so many things I learned actually, but I could only told my 3 lessons above, the rest must be keep for my own.</p><p>To sum up, 2023 is one of my transformative year. I&rsquo;d never know what would 2024 give me, but one thing for sure, Allah knows the best.</p></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button next"><a href=https://dery.dev/posts/thinking-in-moderation/><span class=button__text>Thinking in Moderation</span>
