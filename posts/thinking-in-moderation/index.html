But excessively spending money makes you regret as well for not having retirement saving. Correlation between regretlessness and saving for retirement is not linear.</p><p>In software development, there’s always tradeoff, there’s always an opportunity cost on choosing between one approach besides another. Which one is better, build a bugs free solution but late delivery. Or build a simple, one day delivery but bugs are everywhere. The relation between the quality of being professional and the time taken to develop software with less bugs is also not linear.</p><p>It&rsquo;s always naive to have a linear mindset. The world is not made in binary characteristic, linear correlation. There’s a lot example of it, I just only mention few. If there&rsquo;s an optimal way, it must be somewhere in between. And it applies on every aspects.</p><blockquote><p>Thinking in moderation means thinking in a way that nothing can be called as an optimal unless we believe that the extreme must not the answer of the optimal solution.</p></blockquote></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button next"><a href=https://dery.dev/posts/balancing-high-level-low-level-thinking/><span class=button__text>Balancing High Level Low Level Thinking</span>
