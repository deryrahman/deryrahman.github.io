In a nutshell, those books teach me how to think in a right way. We know, there&rsquo;s many misconception how we understand things because of poor ability to ingest the information. I definitely want to reread these books in 2022. 🤓</li></ul><p>2021 is tough, I&rsquo;ve badly performed self diagnoses that I was mentally exhausted. There&rsquo;s some sequence of events that leads me to think and act differently. Something that I can&rsquo;t barely share through this post. But, this is the lesson I&rsquo;ve learned, everything happen unpredictably, no decision is perfect, and everything is a tradeoff. Just calm, do what you believe in that moment, and let it go. 💃</p><h2 id=extended-memory>Extended memory<a href=#extended-memory class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><p>I often easily forget something, so I utilized note taking app as my extended memory 😄. I created Get the Things Done (GTD), the method developed by David Allen, in Notion. So yeah, I don&rsquo;t really care about the heavy task to remember what I need to do, I just focus on the thing I do at the moment. Let the memory persist in Notion rather than store it in my memory. I believe human&rsquo;s brain is designed to perform the processing task rather than memorizing the detail. We can leverage the effectiveness through delegate the memorizing task on computer.</p><h2 id=healthy-habits>Healthy habits<a href=#healthy-habits class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><p>Yeah, I also tracked my habits in Notion. Fyi, I create a personal tracker that I need to do everyday, currently it&rsquo;s 12-15 checklist, so huge and I felt burnout to do all this personal track. So in 2022, I decide to retract it, and leave my tracker clean (&lt;6 daily checklist). I didn&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s wrong until I work on it right? OOT 🍒</p><p>There&rsquo;s only several lessons I&rsquo;ve learned during 2021. I hope, 2022, I can embrace the mistake I will unintendedly created and take a maximum learning from it to become a better person. 🤭</p></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button next"><a href=https://dery.dev/posts/july-vim-setup/><span class=button__text>July Vim Setup</span>
