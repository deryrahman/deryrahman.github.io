During 2021, most of the time, I felt lost. But, thanks God, they give me precious lessons. As the year will be ended, I always spend time to write reflection in my personal diary. But, for now, I would like to write it down to my blog. So here's some key takeaways I've got during 2021.

## Mental models and resilience

To understand how the world works, I spent time to read 2 books:
- Thinking in Systems: A Primer - Donella Meadows
- The Great Mental Models Volume 1: General Thinking Concepts - Shane Parrish
In a nutshell, those books teach me how to think in a right way. We know, there's many misconception how we understand things because of poor ability to ingest the information. I definitely want to reread these books in 2022. 🤓

2021 is tough, I've badly performed self diagnoses that I was mentally exhausted. There's some sequence of events that leads me to think and act differently. Something that I can't barely share through this post. But, this is the lesson I've learned, everything happen unpredictably, no decision is perfect, and everything is a tradeoff. Just calm, do what you believe in that moment, and let it go. 💃

## Extended memory
I often easily forget something, so I utilized note taking app as my extended memory 😄. I created Get the Things Done (GTD), the method developed by David Allen, in Notion. So yeah, I don't really care about the heavy task to remember what I need to do, I just focus on the thing I do at the moment. Let the memory persist in Notion rather than store it in my memory. I believe human's brain is designed to perform the processing task rather than memorizing the detail. We can leverage the effectiveness through delegate the memorizing task on computer.

## Healthy habits
Yeah, I also tracked my habits in Notion. Fyi, I create a personal tracker that I need to do everyday, currently it's 12-15 checklist, so huge and I felt burnout to do all this personal track. So in 2022, I decide to retract it, and leave my tracker clean (<6 daily checklist). I didn't know if it's wrong until I work on it right? OOT 🍒

There's only several lessons I've learned during 2021. I hope, 2022, I can embrace the mistake I will unintendedly created and take a maximum learning from it to become a better person.
